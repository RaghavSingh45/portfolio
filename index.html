										<h3>Personal Bio</h3>
										<p>I’m Raghvendra (Raghav) Singh, a Ph.D. candidate in the Management Science & Systems department at SUNY Buffalo. I earned my M.S. in Management Information Systems here in 2020, and my current research zeroes in on cybersecurity leadership, AI governance, and human-centered design in healthcare. I’ve published in leading journals and conferences and served as a reviewer for multiple IS journals and conferences. My broader interests span healthcare IT, data privacy, and AI.
</p>
<p>
Before entering academia, I managed products and projects for four years (2017–2022), during which I honed my skills in stakeholder coordination, roadmap planning, and data-driven decision-making. Earlier, I served as an officer in the Indian Army (2013–2015), an experience that shaped my leadership style and commitment to discipline. Based in Buffalo, I collaborate with C-suite executives, IT professionals, and interdisciplinary teams to share my passion for conducting high-value research that makes a difference.</p>

										<h3>Research Bio</h3>
										<p>My work covers three interlocking areas: cybersecurity leadership, AI governance, and human-centered design in healthcare. I investigate how security leaders manage burnout, authority clashes, and shifting priorities, then develop strategies and training programs to strengthen resilience. I also study how organizations balance AI innovation against emerging threats, creating countermeasure models and insider-threat education. In healthcare, I design and evaluate digital tools—from privacy-compliance studies to mental-health apps—and build AI-prompting curricula. I combine grounded theory, design science, social-network analysis, and econometric panels so that academic insights translate into practical guidance for boards and practitioners.</p>

										<h3>Teaching Bio</h3>
										<p>I teach statistics—and, starting Fall 2025, cybersecurity and ethics—by immersing students in real-world challenges from day one. In my statistics classes, learners tackle authentic datasets—whether estimating campaign uplift or building sampling distributions—through hands-on labs that move from spreadsheets to code, supported by rotating roles, regular check-ins, and clear rubrics. Next term I’ll launch Cybersecurity, Privacy & Ethics and Information Assurance, where students will simulate breach responses, defend control choices before a mock board, and run phishing campaigns. My method breaks complex skills into digestible steps—analog exercises come before Wireshark and Autopsy labs—and relies on peer discussion, rapid feedback, and reflection pauses so every student gains confidence and critical insight. I designed and refined Business Statistics and Statistical Decisions in Management (average rating 4.5/5) and am ready to teach additional courses such as Digital Forensics, Systems Analysis & Design, and IT Risk Management.</p>
